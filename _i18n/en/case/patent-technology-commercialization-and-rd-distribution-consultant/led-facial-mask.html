          “Light Guide Film" is a backlight used exclusively for displays such as LED screens. It is already a very mature technology in the market, and its added value is decreasing year by year. In the face of this highly saturated and competitive market, how could we find other application fields that meet market needs so that the products we design can highlight technical value and increase profits?

          Therefore, we focused on the ITRI’s LGF technology and gathered together industries, designers, and technical teams for co-creation. In the R & D process, Dechnology’s innovative design approach was introduced and the new medical skincare concept - “Phantom Mask” was finally revealed. That is to say, a mask that combines LED red light sources was developed. Through the LGF technology’s vertical light penetration properties different wavelengths of light shine on the skin to diminish acne, blemishes or pores.

          「From the field of optoelectronics to the aesthetic medicine industry, the LGF technology now has new application areas, defying the original assumptions and imagination of the original technical team. This new product increased the added value of the technology by ten times, and helped the existing technology overcome the dilemmas faced in commercialization.
